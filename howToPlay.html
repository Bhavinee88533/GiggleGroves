            <li>Preparation:Two players stand facing each other.</li>
            <li>Choose and Declare:Players count to three aloud together, each saying "One, two, three" in unison.On the count of three, each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: <br>

                <br>

                <br>
                Paper covers Stone: Paper wins.
                <br>
                If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie and must be replayed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>TIC TAC TOE</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Preparation:
                <br>
                Draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper or use a game board with a 3x3. <br>
                The grid consists of nine squares, arranged in three rows and three columns.</li>
                <li>Choose Symbols:
                <br>
                 One player chooses the symbol 'X' and the other player chooses 'O'. <br>
                 Traditionally, the player using 'X' goes first, but this can be decided by mutual agreement or a coin toss.</li>
                 <li>Taking Turns:
                    <br>
                  Players take turns placing their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') in one of the empty squares on the grid. <br>
                  The goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
                  <li>Winning the Game:
                    <br>
                    The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. <br>
                    If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie (also called a "cat's game" or "draw").</li>
                    <li>Repeat:
                    <br>
                    Players can reset the grid and play multiple rounds, taking turns starting each game.</li>
        </ul>
